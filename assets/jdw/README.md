JDW examples organized by scope:

- `world/` – full JDW documents (globals + worlds array). Layers/nodes are embedded here; assets stay external (JDA/SDF2D).
- `layer/` – standalone layer definitions for reference/snippets (not for canonical worlds).
- `node/` – standalone node definitions for reference/snippets (not for canonical worlds).

See `docs/jdw_sdf_csg_world_standard_v_0.md` for the full spec; these files are concise examples that match that structure and use local `assets/jda3d` / `assets/jda2d` IDs.
